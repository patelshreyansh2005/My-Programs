I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a boy, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we may be kids
But we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl
I'll be your man (be my man)
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
(I don't deserve this)
Darling, you look perfect
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And you look perfect
I don't deserve this (I don't deserve this)
You look perfect tonight
